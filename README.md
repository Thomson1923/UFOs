# Re: UFO Database 

# Overview of Project
## Per your request, we enhanced the search capabilities available on the UFO Sights website. We enhance the JavaScript code to provide the opportunity for users to enter up to five search criteria and to generate results by simply entering values rather than finding and clicking a separate button. We believe these changes will increase traffic to the UFO Sightings website.

# Results
## Our improvements to the UFO Sightings website streamlines the operation of the site while providing the means for detailed searches. We have modified the website so that merely entering a value in one of the five search criteria boxes initiates a new search and provides an updated output table. These improvements should increase the number of visitors and the average length of stay for those visits. The likely users of this site include:
## - Local Interest: Addition of geographic filters (city, state and country) will allow users to get detailed information on sightings near their home as well as other places of interest including the hometowns of friends and family, vacation spots, major cities, etc.
## - Amateur Investigators: The variety in search criteria may entice users to seek trends such as multiple sightings on the same night, patterns on the shape of objects or repeated events in the same city/state, thereby increasing the length of stay on the website. 
## - Conspiracy Theorists: The comprehensive nature of the initial data set and the ability to quickly find data on “places of interest” (e.g. Roswell, NM) will draw attention for various corners of the world.

# Summary
## We feel that these improvements greatly enhance the value of the UFO Sightings website. However, visitors may be disappointed by the inability to download search results. As follow-up work, we recommend adding download capabilities and adding map-based graphics to enhance the visual impact of the search results.
